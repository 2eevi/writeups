# Exploitation Walkthrough: From Enumeration to Root Access 🚀  

This repository contains a detailed write-up of a penetration testing challenge I worked on.  

## Key Steps Covered
- 🔎 Enumerating open services and directories  
- 🖥️ Exploiting a web-based Bash emulator (`phpbash.php`)  
- 📤 Uploading and executing a PHP reverse shell  
- 🛠️ Stabilizing a TTY for full interactive control  
- ⬆️ Escalating privileges through `scriptmanager` and abusing writable scripts  
- 👑 Gaining root access  

The full step-by-step write-up can be found [here](./WRITEUP.md).

## Why This Matters
This project is not just about getting the root flag — it’s about **methodology**, **documentation**, and **clear reporting**. These are critical skills for roles in:

- Penetration Testing  
- Red Teaming  
- Security Consulting  
- Threat Emulation
